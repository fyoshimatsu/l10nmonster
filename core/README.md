# L10n Monster Core

This is the main L10n Monster package that provides a lot of the core functionality that drives user interfaces such as the [CLI](../cli) and the [VSCode Extension](../vscode-l10nmanager).

You probably don't need to use it directly unless you know what you're doing and are probably building a new tool or user interface.
